------------------------


1. imperative style

    => solving any problem with step-by-step approach
    intention & implementation mixed together


2. declarative/ parameterization style
    => separate implementation from various intention(s)

    programming in java till java 1.7


    decarative programming with Function ==> FUnctional Programming
