Object concepts
----------------------


1.Abstraction / Interface
    => advertise essential features
    why we need ?
    -> easy to use/learn by dependent
    -> loose-coupling b/w dependent & dependency

2. Ecapsulation / Implementation

    => internal Implementation of what we abstracted
    why we need ?
    => to hide complexity to outside-world

3. Inheritance 
    => re-use common data/behavior from more generalized-type to specilized-type

4. Polymorphism
    => do same-behavior in different way based on input/context
